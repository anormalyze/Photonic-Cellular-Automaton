# Photonic Cellular Automaton

This project implements a cellular automaton based on photonic principles and iphotic axioms. It visualizes the interaction of cells governed by different rules inspired by light behavior.

## Features

- Interactive grid of cells
- Four different axioms governing cell behavior
- Real-time simulation of cell interactions
- Start, stop, and reset controls

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use the buttons to control the simulation:
   - Start: Begin the simulation
   - Stop: Pause the simulation
   - Reset: Reinitialize the grid with random states and axioms

Axiom Legend:
☼/☾ - Day/Night Cycle: Represents the alternation between active and dormant states
■~□ - Solid/Empty: Symbolizes the presence or absence of life in a cell
↑↓→ - Movement: Indicates the potential for change or evolution in any direction
◊/◊ - Interaction: Represents the influence of neighboring cells on each other
