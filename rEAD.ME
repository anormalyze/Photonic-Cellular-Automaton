## 🌟 Project Description
   └── The Photonic Cellular Automaton is an interactive web-based simulation that explores the behavior of cellular automata using photonic-inspired rules.

## 🚀 Features
├── Interactive 20x20 grid
├── Four unique axioms governing cell behavior
├── Real-time visualization of cellular evolution
└── Controls for starting, stopping, and resetting the simulation

## 🧬 Axioms
├── ☼/☾ (Day/Night Cycle)
│   └── Represents the alternation between active and dormant states
├── ■~□ (Solid/Empty)
│   └── Symbolizes the presence or absence of energy in a cell
├── ↑↓→ (Movement)
│   └── Indicates the potential for change or evolution in any direction
└── ◊/◊ (Interaction)
    └── Represents the influence of neighboring cells on each other

## 🛠️ Installation
├── Clone the repository
│   └── `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photonic-cellular-automaton.git`
├── Navigate to the project directory
│   └── `cd photonic-cellular-automaton`
└── Open index.html in your web browser

## 🖥️ Usage
├── Open the application in a web browser
├── Observe the initial random state of the grid
├── Use the control buttons:
│   ├── Start: Begin the simulation
│   ├── Stop: Pause the simulation
│   └── Reset: Reinitialize the grid with random states
└── Watch how cells evolve based on their axioms and interactions

## 🧠 How It Works
├── Grid Initialization
│   └── Creates a 20x20 grid of cells, each with a random initial state and axiom
├── Cell Representation
│   ├── State: 0 (inactive) or 1 (active)
│   └── Axiom: One of the four governing rules (0-3)
├── Axiom Implementation
│   ├── ☼/☾ (Day/Night Cycle): Similar to Conway's Game of Life rules
│   ├── ■~□ (Solid/Empty): Activates if surrounded by many active cells
│   ├── ↑↓→ (Movement): State changes based on sum of its state and active neighbors
│   └── ◊/◊ (Interaction): Activates if it has exactly three active neighbors
├── Simulation Loop
│   └── Applies rules and updates the grid at regular intervals
└── Photonic Visualization
    └── Uses HSL color model to represent cell states, brighter colors for active cells
